# OpenCL library, fixtures and other code

This is a repository that contains mostly experimental code related to OpenCL. This is planned to be refactored and split to separate repositories:

1. OpenCL benchmark library (split ready, [Github repo](https://github.com/Kristian-Popov/OpenCL-benchmark))
2. OpenCL utilities library
3. General C++ utilities library
4. My personal collection of OpenCL fixtures such as factorial, Koch curve image, Mandelbrot/Multibrot etc.

This code should be compilable in a similar way to OpenCL benchmark library, but only on Windows ([link to build instructions](https://github.com/Kristian-Popov/OpenCL-benchmark/blob/master/BUILD_WINDOWS.md)).
